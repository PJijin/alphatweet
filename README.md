[ALPHAtweet](https://alphatweet.xyz/) is a open-source project for content sharing powered by [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/). 

An “Alpha” is a piece of exclusive content that is being shared, where **both the creator and the sharer participate in the benefits of sharing when someone unlocks the Alpha**.

While this particular ALPHAtweet experiment emphasizes sharing on Twitter, the magic is that these items of Alpha can be shared *anywhere* by way of share links and, in every case, the creators and sharers **both** have the opportunity to be compensated across *any* platform, every time an Alpha is shared. 

This is not something that could be done before today.

Creators set their own price for unlocking their premium content, the Alpha. They also set a referral percentage bonus that is split with those who share or amplify the content.

In this model, the creator can set the referral percentage bonus to any level they want, based on the creator’s own goals.
